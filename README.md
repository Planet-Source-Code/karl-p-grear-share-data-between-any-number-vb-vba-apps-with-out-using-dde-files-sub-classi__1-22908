## Share data between any number VB/VBA apps with out using DDE, Files, Sub\-classing, and/or Automation


</div>

### Description

Share data between any number VB/VBA apps with out using DDE, Files, Sub-classing, and/or Automation. This code is very fast as it writes the data directly to a named memory space that any application that knows that name can also access. Does not require sub-classing or sending the data each window that needs it. Rather an application writes any amount of data to any number of named memory spaces where it remains until the space is cleared, closed or changed.

Note: You will want to compile the project and run two instances of it to see the code in action.

PLEASE VOTE if you like it :)

Works in 95/98/NT4/2000
